END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR “CENTRO STUDI INFORMATICA di DANILO PRIORE” SOFTWARE
IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: This End User License Agreement (this "EULA") contains the terms and conditions regarding your use of the SOFTWARE (as defined below). This EULA contains material limitations to your rights in that regard. You should read this EULA carefully and treat it as valuable property.
I. THIS EULA.
1. Software Covered by this EULA. This EULA governs your use of the “Centro Studi Informatica di Danilo Priore” software product(s) (“CSIDPS”) enclosed or otherwise accompanied herewith (individually and collectively, the "SOFTWARE"). The term "SOFTWARE" includes, to the extent provided by CSIDPS: 1) any revisions, updates and/or upgrades thereto; 2) any data, image or executable files, databases, data engines, computer software, framework library or similar items customarily used or distributed with computer or mobile software products; 3) anything in any form whatsoever intended to be used with or in conjunction with the SOFTWARE; and 4) any associated media, documentation (including physical, electronic and on-line) and printed materials (the "Documentation").
2. This EULA is a Legally Binding Agreement Between You and CSIDPS. If you are acting as an agent of a company or another legal person, such as an officer or other employee acting for your employer, then "you" and "your" mean your principal, the entity or other legal person for whom you are acting. However, importantly, even if you are acting as an agent for another, you may still be personally liable for violation of federal and State laws, such as copyright infringement.
This EULA is a legally binding agreement between you and CSIDPS. You intend to be legally bound to this EULA to the same extent as if CSIDPS and you physically signed this EULA. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions contained in this EULA. If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this EULA, you may not install or use the SOFTWARE. If, for whatever reason, installation has begun or has been completed, you should cancel installation or un- install the SOFTWARE, as the case may be. (You may click on the "exit" button or its equivalent to immediately abort installation.) If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, then you must promptly return the SOFTWARE to the place of business from which you obtained it in accordance with any return policies of such place of business. Return policies may vary between or among resellers, and you must comply with your particular reseller's return policies as agreed at the point of purchase. If the place of business from which you purchased the SOFTWARE does not honor a complete refund for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of proof of purchase, then you may return the SOFTWARE directly to CSIDPS for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of your purchase. To return the product directly to CSIDPS, you must obtain a CSIDPS Return Authorization Number by contacting CSIDPS, and you must forward all items purchased, including the proof of purchase, directly to CSIDPS. The return must be postage-prepaid, and post-marked within thirty (30) days from the proof of purchase, time being of the essence. The return option to CSIDPS is only available to the original purchaser of an unopened factory packaged item.

II. YOUR LICENSE TO DEVELOP AND TO DISTRIBUTE.
As provided in more detail below, this EULA grants you two licenses: 1) a license to use the SOFTWARE to develop other software products (the "Development License"); and 2) a license to use and/or distribute the Developed Software (the "Distribution License"). Both of these licenses (individually and collectively, the "Licenses") are explained and defined in more detail below.
1. Definitions. The following terms have the respective meanings as used in this EULA:
"Network Server" means a computer with one or more computer central processing units (CPU's) that operates for the purpose of serving other computers logically or physically connected to it, including, but not limited to, other computers connected to it on an internal network, intranet or the Internet. "Web Server" means a type of Network Server that serves other computers more particularly connected to it over an intranet or the Internet.
"Developed Software" means those computer software products that are developed by or through the use of the SOFTWARE. "Developed Web Server Software" means those Developed Software products that reside logically or physically on at least one Web Server and are operated (meaning the computer software instruction set is carried out) by the Web Server's central processing unit(s) (CPU). "Developed Legacy Software" means those Developed Software products that are not Developed Web Server Software, including, for example, stand-alone applications, mobile application and applications accessed by a file server only. "Redistributable Files" means the SOFTWARE files or other portions of the SOFTWARE that are provided by CSIDPS and are identified as such in the Documentation for distribution by you with the Developed Software. "Developer" means a human being or any other automated device using the SOFTWARE in accordance with the terms and conditions of this EULA.
"Developer Seat License" means that each Developer using or otherwise accessing the programmatic interface or the SOFTWARE must obtain the right to do so by purchasing a separate End User License.
“Source Code” shall mean computer software code or programs in human readable format, such as a printed listing of such a program written in a high-level computer language. The term "Source Code" includes, but is not limited to, documents and materials in support of the development effort of the SOFTWARE, such as flow charts, pseudo code and program notes.
2. Your Development License. You are hereby granted a limited, royalty-free, non-exclusive right to use the SOFTWARE to design, develop, and test Developed Software, on the express condition that, and only for so long as, you fully comply with all terms and conditions of this EULA.
The SOFTWARE is licensed to you on a Developer Seat License basis.
The Developer Seat License means that you may perform a single install of the SOFTWARE for use in designing, testing and creating Developed Software by a single Developer on a single computer with a single set of input devices, so long as such computer is used only by one Developer. Conversely, you may not install or use the SOFTWARE on a computer that is a network server or a computer at which the SOFTWARE is used by more than one Developer. You may not network the SOFTWARE or any component part of it, where it is or may be used by more than one Developer unless you purchase an additional Development License for each Developer. You must purchase another separate license to the SOFTWARE in order to add additional developer seats, whether the additional developers are accessing the SOFTWARE in a stand-alone environment or on a computer network.
In all cases, you may not use CSIDPS 's name, logo, or trademarks to market your Developed Software without the express written consent of CSIDPS; (b) you must include the following

CSIDPS copyright notice in your Developed Software documentation and/or in the "About Box" of your Developed Software, and wherever the copyright/rights notice is located in the Developed Software (“Portions Copyright © CSI by Danilo Priore, 1996-2013. All Rights Reserved.”); (c) agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend CSIDPS, its suppliers and resellers, from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees that may arise from the use or distribution of your Developed Software; (d) you may use the SOFTWARE only to create Developed Software that is significantly different than the SOFTWARE.
3. Your Distribution License.
License to Distribute Developed Software. Subject to the terms and conditions in this EULA, you are granted the license to use and to distribute Developed Software on a royalty- free basis, provided that the Developed Software incorporates the SOFTWARE as an integral part of the Developed Software in native compiled format (customarily an ".app", or ".ipa", or ".xcodearchive" etc.). You may not distribute, bundle, library, framework, wrap or subclass the SOFTWARE as Developed Software which, when used in a "designtime" development environment, exposes the programmatic interface of the SOFTWARE.
Distribution of the Evaluation or Trial Version. You may copy the Evaluation Version of this software and documentation as you wish, and give exact copies of the original Evaluation Version to anyone, and distribute the Evaluation Version of the software and documentation in its unmodified form via electronic means.

V. MISCELLANEOUS.
1. This is the Entire Agreement. This EULA (including any addendum or amendment to this EULA included with the SOFTWARE) is the final, complete and exclusive statement of the entire agreement between you and CSIDPS relating to the SOFT-WARE. This EULA supersedes any prior and contemporaneous proposals, purchase orders, advertisements, and all other communications in relation to the subject matter of this EULA, whether oral or written. No terms or conditions, other than those contained in this EULA, and no other understanding or agreement which in any way modifies these terms and conditions, shall be binding upon the parties unless entered into in writing executed between the parties, or by other non-oral manner of agreement whereby the parties objectively and definitively act in a manner to be bound (such as by continuing with an installation of the SOFTWARE, "clicking-through" a questionnaire, etc.) Employees, agents and other representatives of CSIDPS are not permitted to orally modify this EULA.
2. You Indemnify CSIDPS. You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend CSIDPS and its suppliers and resellers from and against any and all claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, which arise out of or result from your breach of any of the terms and conditions of this EULA.

3. Interpretation of this EULA. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this EULA, or any portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this EULA will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this EULA will continue in full force and effect. Formatives of defined terms shall have the same meaning of the defined term. Failure by either party to enforce any provision of this EULA will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Except as otherwise required or superseded by law, this EULA is governed by the laws of the legal offices of Europe, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the legal offices of Europe, and agree that any legal proceedings arising out of this EULA shall be conducted solely in such legal offices. If the SOFTWARE was acquired outside the Europe, then local law may apply.
